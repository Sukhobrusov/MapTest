# MapTest
Quick realization of some features in Google Maps API like Polygons and Markers

I use Retrofit 2 and RxJava 2 for API to get LatLng list and then put the markeres on the map

Gestures:
* Long-tap - adds marker 
* Single-tap on the marker - removes marker
* 3 or more markers connect to each other and form a polygon
